## 📁 **Files Preserved (Essential Only)**

### **kinect_ws/src/ (Cleaned)**
```
kinect_ws/src/
├── install_freenect_from_source.sh  # ✅ KEPT: Comprehensive source installation method
└── README.md                        # ✅ KEPT: Original documentation for reference
```

**Rationale for keeping these files:**
- **`install_freenect_from_source.sh`**: Provides comprehensive source-based libfreenect installation method that complements our modern setup scripts
- **`README.md`**: Original documentation with historical context and specific setup instructions

### **pi_kinect/ (New Package)**
